people are talking about right now You can access X via the web or your mobile device To share information on X as widely as possible we also provide companies developers and users with programmatic access to X data through our APIs   This article explains what Xs APIs are what information is made available through them and some of the protections X has in place for their use At a high level APIs are the way computer programs talk to each other so that they can request and deliver information This is done by allowing a software application to call whats known as an endpoint  an address that corresponds with a specific type of information we provide  X allows access to parts of our service via APIs to allow people to build software that integrates with X like a solution that helps a company respond to customer feedback on X X data is unique from data shared by most other social platforms because it reflects information that users choose to share publicly Our API platform provides broad access to public X data that users have chosen to share with the world We also support APIs that allow users to manage their own nonpublic X information  and provide this information to developers whom they have authorized to do so Accessing X Data When someone wants to access our APIs they are required to register an application  By default applications can only access public information on X Certain endpoints such as those responsible for sending or receiving Direct Messages require additional permissions from you before they can access your information These permissions are not granted by default  you choose on a perapplication basis whether to provide this access and can control all the applications authorized on your account  The X APIs include a wide range of endpoints which fall into five primary groups Accounts and users We allow developers to programmatically manage an accounts profile and settings mute or block users manage users and followers request information about an authorized accounts activity and more These endpoints can help citizen services like the Commonwealth of Virginias Department of Emergency Management which provides information to residents about emergency responses and emergency alerts posts and replies We make public posts and replies available to developers and allow developers to post posts via our API Developers can access posts by searching for specific keywords or requesting a sample of posts from specific accounts These endpoints are used by NGOs like the UN to identify understand and counter misinformation around public health initiatives For example in Indonesia there were persistent rumors that vaccinations either contained pork product or caused infertility Understanding how the rumors started and were spread allowed the UN to get a team on the ground to help dispel these myths which caused particular concern in this Muslimmajority nation Similarly we help researchers listen for early symptomatic indications of disease outbreaks and monitor their spread A team at Northeastern University recently developed a new flutracking technique using X data that forecasts outbreaks up to six weeks in advance much earlier than many other models without sacrificing accuracy Direct Messages Our Direct Message endpoints provide access to the DM conversations of users who have explicitly granted permission to a specific application We do not sell Direct Messages Our DM APIs provide limited access to developers to create personalized experiences on X like Wendys March Madness bracket builder  For accounts they own or manage businesses can create these human or chatbotpowered conversational experiences to communicate directly with customers for customer service marketing and brand engagement experiences Ads We provide a suite of APIs to let developers like Sprinklr  help businesses automatically create and manage ad campaigns on X Developers can use public posts to identify topics and interests and provide businesses with tools for running advertising campaigns to reach the diverse audiences on X Publisher tools and SDKs We provide tools for software developers and publishers to embed X timelines share buttons and other X content on webpages These tools allow brands to bring live public conversations from X into their web experience and make it easy for their customers to share information and articles from their sites You can learn more about our APIs and the specifics of each endpoint in our developer documentation  Across all of our APIs and data products we take our responsibility to protect our users data seriously We maintain strict policies and processes to assess how developers are using X data and restrict improper use of this data  When we learn that a developer violates our policies we will take appropriate action  which can include suspension and termination of access to Xs APIs and data products To learn more about Xs APIs please

Spaces available Anyone can join listen and speak in a Space on X for iOS and AndroidCurrently starting a Space on web is not possible but anyone can join and listen in a Space Who can start a Space People on X for iOS and Android can start a Space Who can see my Space For now all Spaces are public like posts which means they can be accessed by anyone They will automatically appear at the top of your Home timeline and each Space has a link that can be shared publiclySince Spaces are publicly accessible by anyone it may be possible for people to listen to a Space without being listed as a guest in the Space We make certain information about Spaces available through the X Developer Platform such as the title of a Space the hosts and speakers and whether it is scheduled in progress or complete For a more detailed list of the information about Spaces we make available via the X API check out our Spaces endpoints documentation  Can other people see my presence while I am listening or speaking in a Space Since all Spaces are public your presence and activity in a Space is also public unless you choose to listen to a Space anonymously If you are logged into your X account and when you are in a Space and not listening anonymously you will be visible to everyone in the Space as well as to others including people who follow you people who peek into the Space without entering and

with this feature enabled your identity will be hidden to other participants in the Space as well as to people who peek into the Space without entering However when you join anonymously X will still track that you listened to the Space and may use that information to calculate listenership statistics or to personalize your experience on X for example by recommending other content to you While listening anonymously you cannot participate in the Space  To do either of these things you will need to leave the Space and rejoin with the anonymous listening feature turned off What does it mean that Spaces are public Can anyone listen in a Space Spaces can be listened to by anyone on the Internet This is part of a broader feature of Spaces that lets anyone listen to Spaces regardless of whether or not they are logged in to a X account  Because of this listener counts may not match the actual number of listeners nor will the profile photos of all listeners necessarily be displayed in a Space How do I invite people to join a Space Invite people to join a Space by sending an invite via DM posting the link out to your Home timeline or copying the invite link to send it out Who can join my Space For now all Spaces are public and anyone can join any Space as a listener If the listener has a user account you can block their account If you create a Space or are a speaker in a Space

permissions once your Space has been created Select the icon then select Adjust settings to see the options for speaker permissions which include Everyone  People you follow  and the default Only

request to speak from the host Hosts can also invite other people outside of the Space to speak via DM How does cohosting work Up to 2 people can become cohosts and speak in a Space in addition to the 11 speakers  at one time Cohost status can be lost if the cohost leaves the Space A cohost can remove their own cohost status to become a Listener again Hosts can transfer primary admin rights to another cohost If the original host drops from Space the first cohost added will become the primary admin The admin is responsible for promoting and facilitating a healthy conversation in the Space in line with the X Rules  Once a cohost is added to a Space any accounts theyve blocked on X who are in the Space will be removed from the Space Can I schedule a Space Hosts can schedule a Space up to 30

contractual clauses  that have been preapproved by the European Commission On 4 June 2021  the Commission issued modernised standard contractual clauses under the GDPR for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EUEEA  to controllers or processors established outside the EUEEA  These modernised SCCsreplace the three sets of SCCs that were adopted under the previous Data Protection Directive 9546 The Commission developed Questions and Answers  to provide practical guidance on the use of the SCCs and assist stakeholders in their compliance efforts under the GDPR These QAs are based on feedback received from various stakeholders on their experience with using the new SCCs in the first months after their adoption The QAs are intended to be a dynamic source of information and will be updated as new questions arise The Commission is in the process of developing additional sets of SCCs for data transfers to third countries by EU institutions and bodies and for data transfers to controllers or processors outside the EU whose processing operations are directly subject to the GDPR Model clauses around the world Several organisations and third countries are developing or have issued their own model contractual clauses on the basis of converging principles that are also shared by the EU SCCs Some jurisdictions have endorsed the EU SCCs as a transfer mechanism under their own national data protection legislation with limited formal adaptations to their domestic legal order  is a key partner in this respect Together with ASEAN the Commission has developed a Guide on the EU standard contractual clauses and ASEAN model contractual clauses to assist companies present in both jurisdictions with their compliance efforts under both sets of clauses The Guide identifies the commonalities between the two sets of clauses and provides nonexhaustive examples of best practices companies can consider to operationalise safeguards required under the clauses Documents 4 June 2021 DirectorateGeneral for Justice and Consumers Standard contractual clauses for international transfers Modernised standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal

Framework  Dispute Resolution EUUS DPF UK Extension to the EUUS DPF SwissUS DPF Data Privacy Framework  Dispute Resolution Next JAMS Data Privacy Framework  Dispute Resolution The EUUS Data Privacy Framework  the UK Extension to the EUUS Data Privacy Framework  and the SwissUS Data Privacy Framework  were respectively developed in furtherance of transatlantic commerce by the US Department of Commerce and the European Commission the UK Government and the Swiss Federal Administration to provide US organizations with reliable mechanisms for personal data transfers to the United States from the European Union  European Economic Area the United Kingdom  and Switzerland while ensuring data protection that is consistent with EU UK and Swiss law The effective date of the EUUS DPF Principles including the Supplemental Principles and Annex I of the Principles is July 10 2023 which is the date of entry into force of the European Commissions adequacy decision for the EUUS DPF The adequacy decision enables the transfer of EU personal data to participating organizations consistent with EU law Effective as of July 17 2023 eligible organizations in the United States that wish to selfcertify their compliance pursuant to the UK Extension to the EUUS DPF may do so however personal data cannot be received from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar in reliance on the UK Extension to the EUUS DPF before the date that the adequacy regulations implementing the data bridge for the UK Extension to the EUUS DPF enter into force The data bridge will enable the transfer of UK and Gibraltar personal data to participating organizations consistent with UK law The effective date of the SwissUS DPF Principles including the Supplemental Principles and Annex I of the Principles is July 17 2023 however personal data cannot be received from Switzerland in reliance on the SwissUS DPF until the date of entry into force of Switzerlands recognition of adequacy for the SwissUS DPF The recognition of adequacy will enable the transfer of Swiss personal data to participating organizations consistent with Swiss law The Data Privacy Framework  Program which is administered by the International Trade Administration  within the US Department of Commerce enables eligible USbased organizations to selfcertify their compliance pursuant to the EUUS DPF and as applicable the UK Extension to the EUUS DPF andor the SwissUS DPF To participate in the DPF Program a USbased organization is required to selfcertify to the ITA via the Departments DPF Program website  and publicly commit to comply with the DPF Principles While the decision by an eligible USbased organization to selfcertify its compliance pursuant to and participate in the relevant part of the DPF Program is voluntary effective compliance upon selfcertification is compulsory Once such an organization selfcertifies to the ITA and publicly declares its commitment to adhere to the DPF Principles that commitment is enforceable under US law All organizations interested in selfcertifying their compliance pursuant to the EUUS DPF and as applicable the UK Extension to the EUUS DPF andor the SwissUS DPF should review the requirements in their entirety The Departments DPF Program website provides useful information regarding the benefits and requirements of participation in the relevant parts of that program USbased organizations that selfcertify their compliance pursuant to the relevant part of the DPF Program must amongst other things provide readily available recourse mechanisms available to investigate unresolved complaints including a system of alternative dispute resolution  by an independent third party The independent recourse mechanisms must be in place prior to selfcertification and must be available at no cost to the individual Although organizations selfcertifying their compliance pursuant to the relevant part of the DPF Program may utilize private sector developed dispute resolution programs for most categories of personal data covered under their selfcertifications those organizations covering human resources data  transferred from the European Union the United Kingdom or Switzerland must agree to cooperate and comply with the EU data protection authorities  the UK Information Commissioners Office  and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner  respectively with regard to such data JAMS is available to serve as your organizations designated ADR provider and to assist in resolving disputes brought under the DPF Principles up to
